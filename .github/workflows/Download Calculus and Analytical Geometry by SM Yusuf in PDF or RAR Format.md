## Contents of Calculus and Analytic Geometry by SM Yusuf
 
The book consists of ten chapters, each covering a major topic of calculus and analytic geometry. The chapters are as follows:
 
- Chapter 1: Real Numbers, Limits and Continuity
- Chapter 2: The Derivative
- Chapter 3: General Theorem, Intermediate Forms
- Chapter 4: Techniques of Integration
- Chapter 5: The Definite Integral
- Chapter 6: Plane Curves I
- Chapter 7: Plane Curves II
- Chapter 8: Analytic Geometry of Three Dimensions
- Chapter 9: Functions of Several Variables
- Chapter 10: Infinite Series

Each chapter begins with an introduction that summarizes the main concepts and objectives of the chapter. Then, the chapter presents the theory and definitions of the topic, followed by examples that illustrate how to apply the theory to solve problems. The examples are carefully selected to cover different types of problems and situations that students may encounter in their exams or practical work. The examples are also explained in detail, with clear steps and diagrams where necessary.
 
After the examples, each chapter provides a set of exercises that allow students to practice and test their understanding of the topic. The exercises are divided into two categories: routine exercises and supplementary exercises. The routine exercises are designed to reinforce the basic skills and concepts learned in the chapter, while the supplementary exercises are more challenging and require deeper thinking and creativity. The exercises are also graded according to their difficulty level, from easy to hard.
 
At the end of each chapter, there is a section called "Solutions" that provides the answers and solutions to all the exercises in the chapter. The solutions are also written in a clear and concise manner, with explanations and hints where needed. The solutions section is very helpful for students who want to check their work or learn from their mistakes.
