In this article, we will show you how to get started with IntraWeb Ultimate Edition v15.1.8 and create a simple web application using Delphi. You will need the following:

- A copy of RAD Studio 11 Alexandria with Delphi installed.
- A license key for IntraWeb Ultimate Edition v15.1.8.
- An internet connection and a web browser.

First, open RAD Studio and create a new IntraWeb Application project. Choose the Stand Alone Application type and click OK. You will see a blank form in the designer.
 
Next, drag and drop a TIWButton component from the IntraWeb palette to the form. Double-click on the button and write the following code in the OnClick event handler:
 `procedure TIWForm1.IWButton1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  IWLabel1.Caption := 'Hello, world!';
end;` 
Then, drag and drop a TIWLabel component from the IntraWeb palette to the form. Change its Name property to IWLabel1 and leave its Caption property empty.
 
Finally, save your project and run it. You will see a web browser window open with your web application. Click on the button and you will see the label change to 'Hello, world!'.
