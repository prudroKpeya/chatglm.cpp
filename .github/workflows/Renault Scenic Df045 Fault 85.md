According to some online forums[^1^] [^2^], this fault can be caused by a faulty micro switch in the parking brake button, or a bad connection in the parking brake ECU. The micro switch is located inside the button and can wear out over time or get damaged by water or dirt. The ECU is located under the driver seat and can be affected by water ingress or corrosion.
 
To fix this problem, you will need to replace the micro switch or the button assembly, or check and clean the wiring connector under the driver seat. You may also need to erase the fault code using a diagnostic tool or scanner. If you are not confident in doing this yourself, you should take your car to a qualified mechanic or a Renault dealer for further assistance.
 
By fixing this fault, you will ensure that your parking brake system works correctly and safely, and avoid any potential damage or accidents. You will also get rid of the annoying warning light on your dashboard and pass your MOT test without any issues.

Renault Scenic Df045 Fault 85 is not a very common problem, but it can affect some models of the second generation Scenic, which were produced from 2003 to 2009. The parking brake system on these models is electrically operated and controlled by a lever or a button on the dashboard. The system uses a motor unit and cables to apply and release the brake on the rear wheels.
 
The system also has sensors and switches that monitor the status and position of the parking brake. One of these switches is the redundant brake switch, which is supposed to send a signal to the ECU when the parking brake is applied or released manually. However, if this switch fails or gets stuck, it can send an incorrect or inconsistent signal, which triggers the Df045 fault code.
 
This fault code can cause the parking brake warning light to illuminate on the dashboard, and sometimes also display a message such as "Parking Brake Fault" or "Check Parking Brake". The parking brake may still work normally, but it may not release automatically when you drive away. Alternatively, it may not apply properly when you park the car, which can pose a safety risk.
  
If you encounter the Renault Scenic Df045 Fault 85, you should not ignore it or try to reset it by disconnecting the battery. This may only temporarily clear the fault code, but it will not fix the underlying problem. Moreover, it may also affect other systems in your car, such as the radio or the immobilizer. Instead, you should follow the steps mentioned above to diagnose and repair the fault, or seek professional help if you are unsure.
