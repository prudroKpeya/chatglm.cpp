Railworks TS2014 is a train simulator game that lets you drive various trains on different routes. One of the trains you can use is the DT BR Class 4MT 2-6-0 Tender Loco, which is a steam locomotive that was used by the British Railways in the 1950s and 1960s.
 
If you want to cheat in Railworks TS2014 with this train, you will need to use a third-party software that can modify the game files.

2. Launch Railworks TS2014 and select a scenario that uses the DT BR Class 4MT 2-6-0 Tender Loco.
3. Launch Cheat Engine and click on the computer icon on the top left corner to select a process to open.
4. Find and select RailWorks.exe from the list of processes and click Open.
5. In Cheat Engine, click on the Value Type dropdown menu and select Float.
6. In the Value box, enter the current speed of your train in km/h and click First Scan.
7. Go back to Railworks TS2014 and accelerate or decelerate your train slightly.
8. In Cheat Engine, enter the new speed of your train in km/h and click Next Scan.
9. Repeat steps 6 to 8 until you have only one or a few values left in the address list.
10. Select all the values in the address list and click on the red arrow to add them to the cheat table.

Note: This cheat may not work for all scenarios or trains, and may cause glitches or crashes. Use it at your own risk.

If you want to cheat in Railworks TS2014 with other trains or features, you can use the same method as above, but with different values. For example, you can change the fuel level, the brake pressure, the throttle position, the horn sound, and more. You can also use Cheat Engine to freeze or lock values, so they don't change during the game.
 
However, cheating in Railworks TS2014 may not be very fun or satisfying in the long run. The game is designed to simulate realistic train driving and physics, and cheating may ruin the immersion and challenge of the game. You may also encounter errors or bugs that may affect your gameplay or damage your game files. Therefore, it is recommended that you play the game as intended and enjoy the thrill of driving trains on various routes and scenarios.
